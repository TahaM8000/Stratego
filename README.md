# Stratego

This game was created by Sahel and Taha as their final project for the CS50 course. The game combines Taha's work on the core functionality with Sahel's contribution to the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Game

Stratego is a strategic board game that involves two players and a board with a grid of squares. The objective of the game is to capture the opponent's flag while protecting your own. Each player has a set of pieces with different ranks and abilities, and the outcome of each battle is determined by the ranks of the pieces involved.

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/username/stratego.git`
2. Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
3. Compile the Java source code files using the appropriate commands, such as `javac Main.java`.
4. Run the game by executing the compiled Java file, for example, `java Main`.

## Usage

To play Stratego, follow these instructions:

1. Ensure that you have completed the installation steps mentioned above.
2. Start the game by running the Java file as mentioned in the installation steps.
3. Access the game through the provided interface.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the game, make moves, and compete against your opponent.

## Dependencies

Stratego relies on the following dependencies:

- Java Swing: Library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUI).
- Java AWT: Library for creating GUI components, handling events, and managing layouts.
- Java IO: Library for input and output operations.
- Java NET: Library for network-related operations.


Make sure to have these dependencies available in your Java development environment to compile and run the code successfully.
